## Face Up, the features developed
Face Up is a mobile application that allows you to take a photo and present it in the form of a gallery. The photos are identified there with automatically generated tags.

In terms of functionality, we have:
- Take a photo from the app.
- Set up a photo gallery system.
- Use artificial intelligence to identify, in a photo, the approximate age, eye color, gender ... and generate smart tags automatically.

## My tech skills at the end of this project
At the end of this project, I knew:
- Integrate the Expo camera component.
- Send a binary stream on the Frontend side and receive it on the Backend side.
- Integrate the Cloudinary API to store the image bitstream there.
- Integrate an API to retrieve the information returned by the AI after analyzing the binary stream of the image.
